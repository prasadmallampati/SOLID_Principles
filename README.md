# SOLID_Principles
The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles in object-oriented programming and software engineering that help developers create more maintainable, understandable, and flexible software. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin and are commonly used in agile software development. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of each principle:

1 Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): 
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility. This principle encourages developers to design classes that focus on a single task or piece of functionality.

2 Open/Closed Principle (OCP): 
Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that the behavior of a module can be extended without modifying its source code, typically through inheritance or interfaces.

3 Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. This principle ensures that a subclass can stand in for its superclass without causing errors.

4 Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): A client should not be forced to depend on interfaces it does not use. This means that large, monolithic interfaces should be split into smaller, more specific ones so that clients only need to know about the methods that are of interest to them.

5 Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces or abstract classes). Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions. This principle helps to reduce the coupling between different parts of a system.

By adhering to these principles, developers can create more robust, scalable, and maintainable codebases.
